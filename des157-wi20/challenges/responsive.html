            <h2>About Media Queries</h2>

            <p>Media queries are used to deliver a tailored style sheet to different screen size, like desktops, laptops and mobile phones.
                It uses the @media rule to apply CSS properties to the website only if a certain condition is true. It is a useful technique for 
                responsive design. The Min-Width means that an element will apply the properties on media queries when the screen size is greater than
                the min-width. And the Max-width means less than or equal to the width specified in that media query. Starting with small screen setting
                will save much time because the basic layout will also apply to most larger screen. If we start from large screen, some layout will not
                be accepted for small screen and we may need more code to adjust the typography.</p>

            <h2>Relative Units</h2>
        
            <p>Relative length units are relative to other elements of the page, perhaps the size of the parent element's font, or the size of the viewport. 
                The benefit of using relative units is that with some careful planning you can use it so the size of text or other elements scale 
                relative to everything else on the page. There are some most useful units like em, percentage vw, and vh.
            "em" relative to the font size of the parent element. "vw" and "vh" relative to 1% of the viewport's width or height. Percentage is similar to length
            and it is always set relative to some other value like "width: 40%".</p>

            <h2>Meta Viewport Tag</h2>

            <p>Basically, the meta viewport tag offer a number of ways to control how the entire page property displays and behaves on a range of mobile devices. 
                It can set the device width, height, the initial scale and many other properties. With this tag in my html file, my webpage will fit the width of
                desive automatically. Without this tag, we may need to zoom the page in order to fit the width of device screen.
