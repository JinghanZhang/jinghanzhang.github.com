            <h2>Inheritance in CSS</h2>

            <p>When we try to apply certain CSS properties to an element, they will not only affect
                 that specific element but also flow down the branch or branches beneath them. Therefore,
                those lower elements are said to inherit from their ancestors, and sharing same properties.
                For example, div tag and p tag are descendants of the body tag. When we assign properties to body,
                div and p will also have same attributes. The border property is one typical example that is 
                a non-inherited property.</p>

            <h2>Specificity in CSS</h2>
        
            <p>The specificity law states that the more specific the selector, the stronger the rule, and the 
                conflicting style in the stronger rule wins. Inline styles have highest specificity and elements
                have lowest specificity. The browser will decide which CSS selector to use according to the level of
                specificity. For example, "nav a" has higher specificity value then "a", so the browser will apply
                properties assigned in "nav a". A compound selector can mix previous types using more than one class, 
                ID or tag. A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector and the combination of them become
                a multiple selector.</p>

            <h2>ID and Class Attributes</h2>

            <p>The difference between ID and class attributes is that ID can only be used to identify one element, while 
                class can be used to identify more then one element. The symbol for class selector is "." and the symbol 
                for ID is "#".</p>
