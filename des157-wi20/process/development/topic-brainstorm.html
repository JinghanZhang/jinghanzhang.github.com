      <p> - I still did not decide on a specific direction for my final project. So I chose three big topics from the discussion board and tried to 
        generate more ideas and questions related to them. Cyberbullying gradually becomes more common in social media with the development of
      the Internet. People can post and share their lives while they must face more questioning and language attack, especially for those celebrities.
    The public is more willing to comment on celebrities' lives and some of their comments might be negative, which might potentially influence
  their thoughts and mental health. Moreover, cyberbullying has already caused some people to suicide in order to escape from bad comments, which means
we should pay more attention to this negative side of the influences of social media. Online privacy is also related to this problem. More and more website
servers try to access people's personal information without permission and sell them in illegal ways. This is a common problem around the world and everyone
can be tracked by their social media accounts, history of search engine and IP address. It is hard to protect our privacy on the Internet. <br>
     - What I thought about the AI and the access to technology is more related to ethical problems and the equality between different classes in society. Wealthy people
    might have more access to advanced technology and make their lives more convenient, while ordinary people will not have any opportunities to access them. The wealth
    differences between classes are huge and also cause more inequality between the resources they can use. It is much harder for a normal person to change his life.
    When the AI technology has been used for more areas, governments must have strict regulations to control the proper use of them. <br> 
     - Climate change and environmental problems are two big topics in the 21st century. When people's lives become happier, they will gradually pay more attention to their surrounding
    environments. The gas pollution, overuse of plastic products, waster of water and many related problems are potentially caused by the large amount
    of populations. It is hard to solve these problems in a short period of time  completely but there must be some more ways to solve them step by step.</p>
