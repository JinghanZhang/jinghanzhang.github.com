      <p> - I still did not decide a specific direction for my final project. So I chose three big topics from the discussion board and try to 
        generate more ideas and questions that related to them. Cyberbullying gradually becomes more common in social media with the development of
      the Internet. People can post and share their lives while they must face more questioning and language attack, especially for those celebrities.
    The public are more willing to comment on celebrities' lives and some of their comments might be negative, which might protentially influences
  their thoughts and mental health. Moreover, cyberbullying has already cause some people to suicide in order to escape from bad comments, which means
we should pay more attention to this negative side of the influences of social medias. Online privacy is also related to this problem. More and more website
servers try to access to people's personal information without permission and sale them in illegal ways. This is a common problem around the world and everyone
can be tracked by their social media accounts, history of search engine and IP address. It is hard to protect our privacy on the Internet. <br>
     - What I thought about the AI and the access to technology is more related to ethical problems and the equality between different classes in the society. Rich people
    might have more acces to advanced technology and make their lives more convenient, while normal people will not have any opportunities to access them. The wealth
    differences between classes are huge and also cause more inequality between the resources they can use. It is much harder for a normal person to change his life.
    When the AI technology has been used for more areas, governments must have strict regulations to control the proper use of them. <br> 
     - Climate change and environmental problem are two big topics in 21st century. When people's lives becomes happier, they will gradually pay more attention on their surrounding
    environments. The gas pollution, overuse of plastic products, waster of water and many related problems are potentially caused by the large amount
    of populations. It is hard to completely solve these problems in a short period of time but there must be some more ways to solve them step by step.</p>
