        <h2> - Introduction - </h2>
        <p>When people’s basic living quality increases a lot, they tend to focus on related social 
            problems. In modern society, environmental problems gradually become a hot topic in our 
            daily lives. Most countries noticed the overuse of plastic products, the waster of water 
            and some common environmental issues. However, with the development of advanced technology, 
            there are an increasing number of products that have been created to make people have more 
            convenient lives. The environmental issues behind the product design are also worthy of more 
            public attention. Sustainability and environmental friendly also should be considered into 
            the product design process. </p>
        <h2> - Smartphone - </h2>
        <p> 
            The TED Talk named “What is a smartphone made of?” by Kim Preshoff talks about the materials 
            that are usually used to create our smartphone. There are several chemical elements that make 
            up the smartphone. The extracting process for those elements from the earth are complicated. 
            For example the rare earths, which requires a method called open pit mining that exposes vast 
            areas of land, will destroy large areas of natural habitats and causes air and water pollution. 
            The mining of metals also will cause similar problems to the surrounding environments. Moreover,
            phone production also required petroleum, one of the main drivers of climate change. There are 
            many trivial processes behind the phone production which will lead to environmental problems. 
            But in the 21th century, it is hard for modern people to survive without their phone, and the 
            speed to replace the old version phone is also much faster. 
        </p>
        <h2> - App - </h2>
        <p> 
            The sustainability also can be shown through the app design. In the article “Product Design for
            Sustainability”, the author Artiom Dashinsky talks about several ways to promote sustainability 
            through different smartphone applications. For example the printing setting, the system should
            help users to print more content on the same page in order to help them save papers as much as 
            they can. For the online shopping website like eBay, should encourage customers to use the ground 
            shipping, which is slower but more environmental friendly. There are several options that we can 
            decide in our daily lives to promote sustainability and environmental friendly. Everyone can 
            contribute to the protection of natural environments through trivial choices. We all should pay 
            more attention to these issues. The proper design of the app can help users to make a wiser choice. 
        </p>
        <h2> - Process - </h2>
        <p> 
            One of the main rules to design products for sustainability is to consider the eco-design and its
            life-cycle impacts on the environment. As the Eco design specialist Jenni Donato says, about 80% 
            of the cost of a product is set at the design stage, therefore reducing the environmental impact 
            of any product during the concept is the most crucial step. She talks about some techniques to be 
            more environmental friendly during the design process, like choose proper materials which are 
            recyclability, biodegradability, and have high transport efficiency. Designers also should consider 
            the energy efficiency and longevity problems. Since much of our electronic products requires several 
            natural materials, how to improve the design can make those devices can be used for a long time. 
            Considering the smartphone, because of the high replacement rate every year, those smartphone companies 
            should not only care about the income and new improvement of the function, but also should pay more 
            attention to make their products have longer life cycle. If all the designers and users only focus 
            on the product itself and ignore the impact to natural environments, one day we will not be able to 
            access to those new products easily.
