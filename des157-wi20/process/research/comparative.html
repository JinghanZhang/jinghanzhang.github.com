        <p>  - USELESS is an interactive website that related to environmental problems. Basically, 
            it shows the large usage of some products, like plastic, and provide more information 
            for users to learn about how to be more sustainable in daily lives. The target audiences
            are those who live in London.<br><br>

             - I was attracted by the bright color scheme and the cute interactive animation. The main 
            page shows a simple animation to combine and separate the two words “USE” and “Less” to 
            indicate the main purpose of the website. Users can play with those dropping plastic cups,
            bags to see the related data(shown above). Some of the text is hard to see at first which 
            forces users to interact with the website, but I think this can be improved with different
            colors or more playful transform of animations. After the big text “No excuse for single use”,
            people are informed by the main purpose of this website. And there are two options to go to 
            other pages, map and kit. The map page shows a map of London and people can enter the name of
            regions to find the location of zero-waste shop. Since some of those regions do not have any 
            zero-waste shop yet, they also designed a form to collect information from users in order to 
            make their map have more complete information in the future. In the kit page, there are a lot 
            of information about those common wasted products, and tell people how to be more sustainable.<br>
            <br>
             - Overall, I think this is a successful interactive website about environmental issues. It uses 
            limited and simple text to warn people they should be more sustainable in daily lives. The animation 
            and interactive design look good and impressive. The font choice is good but all the capital 
            letters reduce the readability of long text. The illustration style makes the website special 
            and may attract more young people to see the details.

        <p>  - Climate Adaptation Australia is build to propaganda some of their projects that 
            related to climate. On the main page, people can look at the image gallery and 
            read different stories behind it. The text and images combine well. When the 
            screen size is too small, the navigation bar on the right will become invisible 
            automatically. In the navigation bar, there are three main topics that introduce 
            their project in detail, with many sub sections. The layout and clear color 
            contrast make all the text easy to read. Even though the font choice is much more 
            common than USELESS, this font makes the overall website looks more professional. 
            <br><br>
             - I really like the image gallery on the main page, and users can control the image 
            by click and drag. It is a good interactive design for the website. The short title
            on the main page presents crucial information to attract audiences. The vertical 
            navigation bar has bright colors with big text size, but the vertical format makes 
            them hard to read quickly. There is a small rotating cross at the top of each navigation 
            choice, and when user clicks on one of them, the navigation bar will expand with 
            more detailed content list. I think Climate Adaptation Australia is a good example
            to present more professional things to audiences. Comparing with USELESS,  this 
            website use more actual images and clear block layout to make all the text have 
            high readability. The animation for text transform improves user experiences a lot. 
            The search function also works well and fit into the overall style of the website. 
            The search result will also be displayed as blocks. The website does not contain any
            form to receive user messages directly. Instead of using a form, it only provides 
            the contact information of project convenors. In order to make the website works 
            more efficiently, I think they can include a general form to collect questions or 
            suggestions. Therefore, users will be easier to get in touch with those people, 
            and it is also convenient for all of them to get the message directly.
